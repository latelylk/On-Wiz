# Wizard101 Data Mining
Whatever your goal is, if you have an interest in what happens behind-the-scenes in Wizard101, this is the place to start. While I don't plan on covering every aspect of the game, I will be covering the essentials. Requirements will be posted by section.

## W101 Network Communications
The Wizard101 client requires an active connection to a server to load the game. This section will cover how the client communicates with the server.

### What You Need To Know
* Hex editing - At least a basic understanding of it
  * This includes decimal, hexadecimal, and [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_binary) + being able to convert between them

### Your Tools
* Hex Editor - I use the free editor [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20)

### Packets
A packet is a message sent between the server and client to communicate. Game packets can be divided into two categories: Control Messages and DML Messages. 

#### Control Messages

#### DML Messages

## Game Files
Everything the client requires to run is stored in the installation directory of the client.
