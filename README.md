## W101 Network Communications
The Wizard101 client requires an active connection to a server to load the game. This section will cover how the client communicates with the server.

### Packets
A packet is a message sent between the server and client to communicate. Game packets can be divided into two categories: Control Messages and DML Messages. 

#### Control Messages

#### DML Messages

## Game Files
Everything the client requires to run is stored in the installation directory of the client.
